This repository contains a Unity project with the core modules and assets for our synthetic data generator, M3Act. 
We also release the 3D group activity dataset, M3Act3D, as well as the essential tools for data processing, visualization, and evaluation of the dataset.

## Introduction
**TLDR**. M3Act is a synthetic data generator with multi-view multi-group multi-person atomic human actions and group activities.
![Teaser](assets/Teaser.png)
M3Act is designed to support multi-person and multi-group research. It features multiple semantic groups and produces highly diverse and photorealistic videos with a rich set of annotations suitable for human-centered tasks including multi-person tracking, group activity recognition, and controllable human group activity generation.
